Their main focus is on creating opportunities that span various areas, including leadership development, learning, student engagement, and fostering sharedÂ interests.  I have accepted an internship offer letter from CodSoft . Greatful for this opportunity and contributing my skills to the dynamic team at CodSoft . I have completed a journey of learning "java programming" with CodSoft. I have completed Three task of projects which are shown in follow :

# Number Game Project in Java
Overview:
The Number Game project in Java is an interactive console-based application where users attempt to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The project enhances user engagement by incorporating features like limited attempts, multiple rounds, and a scoring system based on the number of attempts or rounds won.

Key Features:
Random Number Generation: The program generates a random number within a predefined range (e.g., 1 to 100).
User Interaction: Users are prompted to enter their guesses for the generated number.
Guess Comparison: The program compares the user's guess with the generated number, providing feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.
Limited Attempts: To add a challenge, users are given a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number.
Multiple Rounds: Users have the option to play multiple rounds, making the game more engaging.
Scoring System: The scoring system can be based on the number of attempts taken or the number of rounds won, enhancing competition and motivation.

Code Structure:
Random Number Generation: Utilize Java's Random class to generate a random number within the specified range.
User Interaction: Use Scanner class for user input, prompting users to enter their guesses.
Guess Comparison: Implement logic to compare user guesses with the generated number and provide feedback.
Limited Attempts: Introduce a counter to track the number of attempts and set a maximum limit.
Multiple Rounds: Enclose the game logic within a loop to allow for multiple rounds. Users can choose whether to continue playing.
Scoring System: Implement a scoring system based on the number of attempts or rounds won.
Input Validation: Ensure proper input validation to handle invalid inputs or unexpected data.

# Word Counter Project in Java
Overview: 
The Word Counter project in Java is designed to analyze and process textual data, providing insights into the word count, frequency of words, and other statistical information. This console-based application incorporates functionalities to read text input from the user or a file, count words, and present additional statistics like the number of unique words and the frequency of each word.

Key Features:
User Interaction: Users can provide input either by entering text manually or by providing the path to a file.
Text Processing: The program processes the input text, splitting it into words using space or punctuation as delimiters.
Word Count: The core functionality involves counting the total number of words present in the text.
Additional Statistics: The application offers statistics such as the number of unique words and the frequency of each word.
Input Validation: Robust input validation ensures that the program handles empty inputs or file errors gracefully.
User-Friendly Interface: The user interface is designed to be clear and concise, displaying relevant information in an organized manner.

Code Structure:
Text Input: Utilize the Scanner class for manual text input or use file handling techniques to read text from a file.
Text Processing: Implement logic to split the input text into an array of words using appropriate delimiters.
Word Count: Track the count of words using variables and loops to iterate through the array.
Additional Statistics: Utilize data structures like maps to store and analyze word frequency. Calculate the number of unique words.
Input Validation: Implement checks for empty inputs, file existence, and other potential issues.

# ATM Interface Project in Java
Overview:
The ATM Interface project in Java simulates the interaction between users and an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). This console-based application provides users with the ability to perform essential banking operations such as withdrawing cash, depositing funds, and checking their account balance. The project also ensures user input validation, transaction security, and informative messages to guide users through their banking activities.

Key Features:

User Authentication: Users may access the ATM by providing a secure identification method, such as a PIN.
Transaction Operations: Users can perform common banking transactions, including cash withdrawal, fund deposit, and balance inquiry.
Account Interaction: The ATM interfaces with a bank account class, allowing the manipulation of the user's account balance.
Input Validation: The application ensures that user inputs are validated to prevent errors and enhance security.
User-Friendly Interface: The console-based interface is designed to be intuitive, providing clear instructions and transaction feedback.

Code Structure:
User Authentication: Implement a method to authenticate users, such as by verifying a PIN.
Transaction Operations: Design methods for key transactions like cash withdrawal, deposit, and balance inquiry.
Account Interaction: Connect the ATM class with a bank account class, allowing the ATM to access and modify the user's account balance.
Input Validation: Implement checks to validate user input, ensuring that amounts entered are within acceptable limits and that PINs are secure.
User-Friendly Interface: Utilize the Scanner class for user input and display informative messages throughout the transaction process.
